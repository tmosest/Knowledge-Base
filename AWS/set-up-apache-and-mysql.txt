==============================================================
See the file on connecting if you don't know how to connect.
==============================================================

1) First we need to update any existing software, after connecting to your aws istance through the command prompt type the following.

  sudo yum update -y
  
2) After that we use yum install to setup all the software we will need.

  sudo yum install -y httpd24 php56 mysql55-server php56-mysqlnd
  
3) Start the Apache web server.
  
   sudo service httpd start
  
4) You should see a green [ OK ]. Now we add Apache to the boot up files by typing.

  sudo chkconfig httpd on
  
5) Now you can check that it was added to the start up with:

  chkconfig --list httpd
  
  [You want to see 1:off 2:on 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off]
  
6) Check that it worked by going to the public ip address of your AWS instance [found on the aws website in your instance info] in
    your web browser. You should see an Amazon Linux Test Page  
    
  [Apache will show all files in you /var/www/html folder]
  
====================================
Set File Permissions
====================================

1) Add the www group to your instance.
  
  sudo groupadd www
  
2) Add your user (in this case, ec2-user) to the www group.

  sudo usermod -a -G www ec2-user
  
3) Log out and then log back in again, and verify your membership in the www group.

  exit
  
4) After logging back in use below to check your permissions:

  groups
  
  [Should return: ec2-user wheel www]
  
5) Change the group ownership of /var/www and its contents to the www group.

  sudo chown -R root:www /var/www
  
6) Change the directory permissions of /var/www and its subdirectories to add group write permissions 
    and to set the group ID on future subdirectories.
    
  sudo chmod 2775 /var/www
  
  find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} +
  
7) Recursively change the file permissions of /var/www and its subdirectories to add group write permissions.

  find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} +
  
====================================
Test Apache
====================================

1) Create a simple PHP file in the Apache document root.

  echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
  
2) In a web browser, enter the URL of the file you just created. 
   This URL is the public DNS address of your instance followed by a forward slash and the file name. For example:
   
   http://my.public.dns.amazonaws.com/phpinfo.php
   
3) Delete the phpinfo.php file. Type the following into a command prompt.

  rm /var/www/html/phpinfo.php

========================================
Secure MySQL
========================================

1) Start the MySQL server so that you can run mysql_secure_installation.

  sudo service mysqld start
  
2) Run mysql_secure_installation.

  sudo mysql_secure_installation
  
3) When prompted for root password enter it (if set) if not press ENTER.

4) Type Y to set a new password. Set it and then type y for the next questions.

4.5) Either stop or mysql or add it to the start up files depending on what you need.

  sudo service mysqld stop
  
  sudo chkconfig mysqld on
  
===============================================
Setup phpMyAdmin
===============================================
1) Enable the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository from the Fedora project on your instance.

  sudo yum-config-manager --enable epel
  
2) Install the phpMyAdmin package.

   sudo yum install -y phpMyAdmin
   
3) Configure your phpMyAdmin installation to allow access from your local machine. 
    By default, phpMyAdmin only allows access from the server that it is running on, 
    which is not very useful because Amazon Linux does not include a web browser.
    
    [If you need your own ip address Google it or user whatsmyip.com]
    
    sudo sed -i -e 's/127.0.0.1/your_ip_address/g' /etc/httpd/conf.d/phpMyAdmin.conf
    
4) Restart the Apache web server to pick up the new configuration.

  sudo service httpd restart
  
5) In a web browser, enter the URL of your phpMyAdmin installation.

  http://my.public.dns.amazonaws.com/phpmyadmin or http://my_amazon_public_ip/phpMyAdmin
