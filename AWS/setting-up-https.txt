Tutorial on setting up HTTPS 
===================================================================================================================

I) Method 1: Self Signing

  1) Connect to you AWS instance [see tutorial on this if neccessary] then check to see if httpd is running with:
  
    sudo service httpd status
    
  1.5) If its not running start it with:
  
    sudo service httpd start
    
  2) Update all software with:
  
    sudo yum update -y
    
  3) Now that your instance is current, add SSL/TLS support by installing the Apache module mod_ssl:
    
    sudo yum install -y mod24_ssl
    
  [ We now have 3 new files 
  
      1) /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf : The configuration file for mod_ssl. 
      It contains "directives" telling Apache where to find encryption keys and certificates, 
      which SSL/TLS protocols to allow, and what encryption algorithms to use.
      
      2) /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key : An automatically generated, 
      2048-bit RSA private key for your Amazon EC2 host. During installation, 
      OpenSSL used this key to generate a self-signed host certificate, 
      and you can also use it later to generate a certificate signing request (CSR) 
      to submit to a certificate authority (CA).
      
      3) /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt : An automatically generated, 
      self-signed X.509 certificate for your server host. This certificate is useful for 
      testing that Apache is properly set up to use SSL/TLS.
  ]
  
  4) Now we restart Apache
  
    sudo service httpd restart
    
  5) If you browser times out you need to add HTTPS to the Security Group on your AWS Instance.
