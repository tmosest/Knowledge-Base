Updating Warpzit's answer for Android Studio 1.3.2 (differences in bold)

1) First get latest volley with git. (git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley)
2) In your current project (android studio) click [file] --> [New]--> [New Module].
3) Now select [Import Gradle Project], Click Next
4) Now select the directory where you downloaded Volley to.
5) Now Android studio might guide you to do the rest but continue guide to verify that everything works correct
6) Open settings.gradle (find in root) and add (or verify this is included):

include ':app', ':volley'

Now go to your build.gradle in your project and add the dependency:

compile project(":volley")
