Install:

  sudo gem install cocoapods
  
Setup:

  pod setup --verbose

Init Pods:

  cd ~/Path/To/Folder/Containing/
  
  pod init
  
  open -a Xcode Podfile
  
  Replace the two commented lines with the following:
  
  platform :ios, "8.0"
  use_frameworks!
  
  This tells CocoaPods that your project is targeting iOS 8.0 and will be using frameworks instead of static libraries.
  In order to use CocoaPods written in Swift, you must explicitly include use_frameworks! to opt into using frameworks. If you forget to include this, and CocoaPods detects you’re trying to use a Swift CocoaPod, you’ll get an error when you try to install the pods.
  
Pod install example:

  It’s finally time to add your first dependency using CocoaPods. Add the following to your Podfile, inside the first target block:
pod 'Alamofire', '2.0.2'

  pod install
