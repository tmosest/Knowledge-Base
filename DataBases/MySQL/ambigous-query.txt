SQL will fail if the query is too ambigous this will happen if the a field name is the same on multiple tables
that are being joined together. (Id is a prime field for this to happen on)

Method1: full table name

  SELECT tbl_names.id, tbl_section.id, name, section
  FROM tbl_names
  JOIN tbl_section ON tbl_section.id = tbl_names.id 

  
  
Method2: alias table name (I like this one)

  SELECT n.id, s.id, n.name, s.section
  FROM tbl_names n
  JOIN tbl_section s ON s.id = n.id
