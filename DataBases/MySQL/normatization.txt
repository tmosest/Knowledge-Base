Database normalization (or normalisation) is the process of organizing the columns 
(attributes) and tables (relations) of a relational database to minimize data redundancy.

Normalization involves decomposing a table into less redundant (and smaller) tables without losing information; 
defining foreign keys in the old table referencing the primary keys of the new ones. 
The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute
can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.

1. To free the collection of relations from undesirable insertion, update and deletion dependencies;
2. To reduce the need for restructuring the collection of relations, as new types of data are introduced, and thus increase 
the life span of application programs;
3. To make the relational model more informative to users;
4. To make the collection of relations neutral to the query statistics, where these statistics are liable to change as time goes by.
