You just need imagepng() then. In fact it almost becomes a one-liner:

imagepng(imagecreatefromstring(file_get_contents($filename)), "output.png");
You would use $_FILES["id"]["tmp_name"] for the filename, and a different output filename obviously. But the image format probing itself would become redundant.
