Primitives
The PHPDoc Standard, and thus phpDocumentor, can refer to all primitive types in PHP.

Here is a full listing;

string
A piece of text of an unspecified length.

int or integer
A whole number that may be either positive or negative.

float
A real, or decimal, number that may be either positive or negative.

bool or boolean
A variable that can only contain the state ‘true’ or ‘false’.

array
A collection of variables of unknown type. It is possible to specify the types of array members, see the chapter on arrays for more information.

resource
A file handler or other system resource as described in the PHP manual.

null
The value contained, or returned, is literally null. This type is not to be confused with void, which is the total absence of a variable or value (usually used with the @return tag).

callable
A function or method that can be passed by a variable, see the PHP manual for more information on callables.
