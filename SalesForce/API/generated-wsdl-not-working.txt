If you can't access custom objects after updating your WSDL file then youre cacheing it.

Add

ini_set("soap.wsdl_cache_enabled", "0"); 


in your PHP File before you call your WSDL file to load the current one!!!


Example:

$mySforceConnection = new SforceEnterpriseClient();
		ini_set("soap.wsdl_cache_enabled", "0"); //Amazing hack to not cache enterprise file
		$mySforceConnection->createConnection("sfapi/soapclient/enterprise.wsdl.xml");
		$login = $mySforceConnection->login(USERNAME, PASSWORD.SECURITY_TOKEN);
